A curated list of resources for graph databases and graph computing tools

## Graph databases

* [AgensGraph](http://bitnine.net/agensgraph/) - multi-model graph database with SQL and Cypher support
* [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) - highly available Multi-Model NoSQL database
* [Blazegraph](https://github.com/blazegraph/database) - GPU accelerated graph database
* [Cayley](https://github.com/cayleygraph/cayley) - open source database written in Go
* [CosmosDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph-introduction) - cloud-based multi-model database with support for TinkerPop3
* [DSE Graph](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-graph) - Graph layer on top of DataStax Enterprise (Cassandra, SolR, Spark)
* [Grakn.AI](https://grakn.ai/) - a distributed hyper-relational database for knowledge-oriented systems, i.e. a distributed knowledge base
* [JanusGraph](http://janusgraph.org) - an open-source, distributed graph database with pluggable storage and indexing backends
* [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) - High Performance, In-Memory, Transactional Graph Database
* [Neo4j](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/currentg/#neo4j-gremlin) - OLTP graph database
* [Sparksee](http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/#sparksee) - makes space and performance compatible with a small footprint and a fast analysis of large networks
* [Stardog](http://stardog.com/) - RDF graph database with OLTP and OLAP support
* [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com/orientdb/) - Distributed Multi-Model NoSQL Database with a Graph Database Engine

### Triple stores

* [AllegroGraph](https://franz.com/agraph/allegrograph/) - high-performance, persistent graph database that scales to billions of quads
* [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) - open source Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
* [Eclipse RDF4J](http://rdf4j.org/) - (formerly known as Sesame) is an open source Java framework for processing RDF data. This includes parsing, storing, inferencing and querying of/over such data. It offers an easy-to-use API that can be connected to all leading RDF storage solutions. It allows you to connect with SPARQL endpoints and create applications that leverage the power of linked data and Semantic Web.
* [GraphDB](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/graphdb/) - enterprise ready Semantic Graph Database, compliant with W3C Standards
* [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/) - a "Data Junction Box" that drives enterprise and individual agility by deriving a Semantic Web of Linked Data from existing data silos

## Graph computing frameworks

* [Apache Giraph](https://giraph.apache.org/) - an iterative graph processing system built for high scalability
* [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) - a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP)
* [Apache Spark - GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) - Apache Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation

## Languages

* [Cypher](http://www.opencypher.org/)
* [Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html)
* [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL)
